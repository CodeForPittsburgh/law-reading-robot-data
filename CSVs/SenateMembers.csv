He's proud to be raising his sons, Ishaan and Mayukh, in South Philadelphia with his wife, Shannon Garrison, a historic preservationist. Saval's organizing is deeply rooted in the labor movement. From 2009 to 2013, he was a volunteer labor organizer with UNITE HERE, organizing boycotts against luxury hotel developers to fight for the rights of housekeepers and helping to win back the jobs of noontime aides laid off because of Governor Tom Corbett's budget cuts. Saval also has extensive experience in community and electoral organizing. In 2016, he was a leader in U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. From this experience, Saval went on to co-found Reclaim Philadelphia, a progressive organization working for racial, gender, and economic justice throughout the Philadelphia area. In 2018, he organized campaigns to fight for change in the Democratic Party and was elected as Leader of Philadelphia's Democratic Second Ward. Saval was the first Asian American to hold the position of Ward Leader in Philadelphia. In his career as a writer, Saval has been a frequent contributor to The New York Times and a contributing writer for The New Yorker, covering architecture, design, and housing. Saval previously served as co-editor of the literary journal n+1 and still serves on its board of directors. In 2014, Saval published his book Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace. In Cubed, he examined the long-term evolution of the office from its roots in 19th century counting houses all the way to the cubicle, ultimately presenting a world in which workplaces, and the lives of the workers within them, could be improved in the future. Saval's parents immigrated to the United States from Bangalore, India. In 1982, the year Saval was born, his parents opened a pizza restaurant, where Saval spent much of his childhood and adolescence. The employees of the restaurant were immigrants of all statuses, and Saval's parents helped many of them secure documentation. His family's experiences, as immigrants and as small business owners, were formative for Saval, giving shape to his perspective on workers' rights. Much of Saval's spring 2020 campaign for Pennsylvania State Senate took place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented global hardship. In response, his campaign transformed rapidly to a mutual aid hub. Saval is deeply committed to solidarity and justice for working people. He is fighting for a Philadelphia and Pennsylvania that works for the many and not the few.",,,1434 Germantown Ave.,,"Philadelphia, PA 19122",(215) 952-3119,1107-09 S. 6th Street,,"Philadelphia, PA 19147",(267) 668-3550,,,,,543 Main Capitol,,"Harrisburg, PA 17120",(717) 787-5662,https://www.legis.state.pa.us/images/members/200/1921.jpg,,false

After witnessing the September 11th attacks from the window of his law office in Newark, New Jersey, Steve decided to seek a new career in teaching as a way to serve the community. After a couple years of night classes at Holy Family University, Steve received his state certification and was hired as a social studies teacher at Bensalem High School. At BHS he worked hard to give the next generation a strong foundation in history and civics to help them succeed and participate fully as citizens of our country. <br /><br />At about that same time, Steve became a leader in a grassroots movement to stop a big box shopping mall in Lower Makefield. That experience led him to run for township supervisor. He was elected in 2003. As a supervisor he worked with both Republicans and Democrats alike. He led efforts to make government more open and transparent, to solve traffic problems, and to preserve open space and the environment. In 2008, Steve ran and won the State House seat in the Yardley-Newtown area of Bucks County. In Harrisburg he was a reformer, writing the bill that would ultimately get adopted as new House rules on keeping politics and government service separate; refusing perks like per diems and a state car; and not collecting his pay during prolonged budget impasses in 2009 and 2015-16. Steve was also a leader on education, infrastructure investment, environmental protection, women's health issues and gun violence prevention.<br /><br />Back home in Bucks County, Steve led the effort to get PECO to improve the resiliency of its electric grid, vastly reducing the number of power outages in the area. He also worked to bring jobs into his district and successfully lobbied the New Jersey Legislature to grandfather current employees when it passed a new law requiring all public sector workers in the Garden State to live in New Jersey, thereby saving the jobs of thousands of Bucks residents who worked across the Delaware River. In 2017, Attorney General Josh Shapiro appointed Steve the first Chief Deputy Attorney General for Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania. In that role, Steve oversaw the prosecution of environmental crimes and led Pennsylvania's efforts to fight the Trump Administration over proposed rollbacks of important environmental protections. Steve is a graduate of Tufts University where he received his B.A. He received his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and his M.Ed. from Holy Family University. Steve and his wife Ronni have lived in the same house in Lower Makefield for over 23 years.

First elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1994, Senator Boscola served two terms in the state House and is serving her fifth term representing the 18th Senatorial District, consisting of Northampton and Lehigh Counties.

Senator Boscola has been a leading proponent of the total elimination of the local school property tax and has been a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 76. Every Session, she has also introduced legislation to freeze property taxes on seniors so that they can remain in their homes. Redistricting reform has been an issue that Senator Boscola has continued to fight for through the years by introducing legislation to amend the Pennsylvania Constitution, and change the way the Commonwealth conducts the redistricting process by removing politics and creating a truly Independent Citizen's Commission. Senator Boscola has also focused on the need for state government to promote economic development initiatives to provide family sustaining jobs to the Lehigh Valley and across the Commonwealth. She has worked diligently to bring the Lehigh Valley region our fair share of state funds for worthwhile local projects. She has been a strong advocate for funding economic development programs with proven track records of job creation and retention such as the Ben Franklin Technology Centers, Small Business Development Center and the Manufacturer's Resource Center. Working with the private sector to drive growth, job expansion and retention has been a focus for Senator Boscola. Cutting out the red tape, ensuring the State's incentives are competitive with surrounding states is one way government can help promote growth. Most recently, Senator Boscola was the proud prime sponsor of the omnibus bill, Senate Bill 421 of 2019-20, which is known, today, as Act 77 of 2019. Act 77 was the largest voting modernization bill in decades that included the elimination of straight party voting, extending the deadline for absentee ballot submissions, and created a no excuse mail-in voting option for all Pennsylvania voters, in which, ""kitchen tables and living rooms will be converted in polling places. Researching a candidate can be done while you vote from the comfort of your own home."" Senator Boscola was instrumental in bringing a City Revitalization and Improvement Zone (CRIZ) designation to Bethlehem. Senator Boscola fought hard to ensure that Bethlehem had an opportunity to submit a CRIZ application and has worked to ensure that the incentive will be a tool that would drive new growth to the region. It was in Senator Boscola's recognition that staying competitive required creative incentives to help generate new growth in the region, which is what the CRIZ accomplished. As our region continued to recover from the loss of Bethlehem Steel, the CRIZ looked to leverage new state tax increments to complete difficult development projects in Bethlehem and beyond.

She is the first woman in the history of the Pennsylvania Legislature to serve as Senate Pro Tempore and Senate Majority Leader in either the Pennsylvania House or Senate. <br /><br />In 2008, Senator Ward won the Pennsylvania 39th Senatorial District seat and was the first woman ever elected to that seat. She was re-elected in 2012 and 2016, and most recently in 2020. During the 2019-20 legislative session, she was appointed to the Majority Caucus Administrator position in the Senate. Prior to her election to the Senate, she served as a Westmoreland County Commissioner in 2008, and on the Hempfield Township Board of Supervisors from 2002-07, where she was Chairwoman of the Board.<br /><br />In her role as Senate Majority Leader and representing the 39th district in Westmoreland, the foundation of every decision by Senator Ward is based on what is good for Pennsylvanians and our Commonwealth.<br /><br />Reaching across the aisle, Senator Ward has worked in a bipartisan manner to help lead the General Assembly through the COVID-19 pandemic and put measures in place to position the Commonwealth to transition out of crisis and on to a path of prosperity.<br /><br />Maintaining the balance of government responsibility, to prevent government overreach, was critical during the pandemic, and Senator Ward led efforts to ensure the people's voice was not lost by advancing a constitutional amendment giving the people a say through the introduction of Senate Bill 2, which instituted the largest transfer of executive power since President Herbert Hoover. Under her leadership, Senator Ward was also able to advance legislation that set best practices in the areas of regulatory reform including hospital funding - making some health care and business waivers permanent - while ensuring fiscal solvency with the state budget and replenishing our state rainy day fund in the last two budget cycles.<br /><br />As part of an overall strategy to move beyond the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Ward also worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure that Pennsylvania could recover more quickly from an economic perspective by focusing on unleashing our energy potential, positioning small- and medium-sized businesses to thrive and large corporations to stay, grow, invest, and relocate to our state all to create good paying jobs for Pennsylvania workers.<br /><br />Delivering on that promise, Senator Ward advanced efforts to reduce the Corporate Net Income Tax (CNIT) for Pennsylvania, taking it from one of the highest in the nation to phasing it down to one of the most competitive rates among states. She also helped to provide more certainty for businesses through regulatory reform and make tax code adjustments for small- medium-sized businesses.<br /><br />In addition to her work as Majority Leader, Senator Ward's legislative accomplishments include passing laws reducing spending on state-subsidized methadone treatment transportation; implementing the federal E-Verify program to ensure workers on publicly funded construction projects are legally permitted to work; and re-authorizing the emergency services grant program. A champion for the welfare of children and youth, Senator Ward also led efforts to enact legislation reforming Pennsylvania's child abuse laws and providing greater protections for children against abuse. Most recently, Senator Ward championed legislation to expand Megan's Law to include the sex trafficking of minors to the sex offender registry, offering one more resource to reduce such heinous acts. Her Ready to Succeed legislation created one of the most successful higher education grant programs that helps middle-class families. Senator Ward also helped to extend benefits to the families of campus police officers who die in the line of duty, championed efforts to ensure continued access to quality eye care for patients and added more crime victim representation within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD), so policy and funding priorities for crime victim assistance are being decided by a more diverse representation of Pennsylvanians affected by crime.<br /><br />She is a member of Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church in Hempfield Township, the Italian Sons and Daughters of America and the NRA. Senator Kim Ward is a native southwestern Pennsylvania resident who grew up in Meadowlands, Washington County.
