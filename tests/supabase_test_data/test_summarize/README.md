Note that because the text of a bill contains commas, the text itself cannot be saved in the revision_text_data.csv. Thus, the text for each must be manually imported.

Each "rt_text_#.txt" file contains the text for the equivalently-numbered row in revisions_text_data.csv and must be copy-pasted into that row.
